AudioFilter
====================

Applies different filters (HighPass, LowPass, BandPass) to an audio file
and visualizes the result in the frequency spectrum.
Use the keys 'h' (HighPass), 'l' (LowPass), 'b' (Bandpass) to change the applied filter.
The project comes with a demo audiofile ([Lyonn - Empty Bed](https://www.jamendo.com/de/list/a145856/we-ll-light-the-sky))
